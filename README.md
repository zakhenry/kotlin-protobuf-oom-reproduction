## Steps to reproduce

1. Run `./gradlew build`
2. See that it runs out of memory (or uses a lot of memory depending on system setup?)

If you change the number of messages in `src/main/proto/hello_world.proto` you can find a threshold where the size is ok.


# Compare with Java protos

1. `git checkout java-api-only`
2. Run `./gradlew build`

For me this completes in 13s from cold build (`rm -rf ./build`). Compare with crashing out of memory after nearly 
10 minutes with Kotlin protos
